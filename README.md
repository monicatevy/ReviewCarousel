- DOMContentLoaded
- addEventListener()
- array.length
- classList
- textContent
- Number.isInteger(x)

### Note to self:
 - I was using Chrome as my development browser since the beginning when I started writing HTML and CSS. Chrome is a great browser, and for JS debugging it has the upperhand, however I decided to switch to Firefox not just for the CSS-centric devtools but because of Mozilla's policy on corporate transparency and protection of user privacy.

- I realize I was writing responsive CSS the wrong way by designing websites for desktop first rather than mobile first. I now understand I was making complex layout and overwriting everything for a simple layout when I was starting with a simple responsive functionning layout in the first place.
    
- I think the main reason why people do desktop first is because when they start learning CSS they learn and practice it for the desktop so they keep it going. But by doing desktop first, I got trap myself and it causes so much trouble that I never want to do it again.
